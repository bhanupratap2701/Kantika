    <h2>Kantika Import Export & Trading Defrauds KM Corporation of ₹4.78 Crore</h2>

    <p>In a significant development highlighting the ongoing export-import scam linked to <strong>Kantika Import Export and Trading Pvt Ltd</strong>, a Rajkot-based trading company <strong>KM Corporation Pvt Ltd</strong> has filed a police complaint after being defrauded of <strong>₹4.78 crore</strong> in a fake sulphur granule deal.</p>

    <p>According to a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/sulphur-trading-firm-defrauded-of-4-78cr-by-five/articleshow/113792355.cms" target="_blank">report by the Times of India</a>, KM Corporation was approached by trader <strong>Parag Desai</strong> in 2023, who introduced them to <strong>Vishwam Sharma</strong> of Kantika. A deal was made to purchase 10,000 metric tons of sulphur granules for $990,000, with ₹4.25 crore paid upfront and an additional ₹53 lakh spent on logistics.</p>

    <p>However, the goods were never delivered. The scheduled shipment between September and November 2023 to Hazira Port never materialized. Upon investigating, KM Corporation discovered that <strong>Vishwam Sharma</strong> and <strong>Kapil Sharma</strong> acted as managers, while the official directors listed were <strong>Chanchal Rani Sharma</strong> and <strong>Mayadevi Sharma</strong> — consistent with prior cases where family members are used as dummy directors to mask liability.</p>

    <p>A formal police complaint has been filed at the Airport police station in Rajkot. This case adds to the growing body of evidence indicating a broader pattern of trade fraud, rebranding, and corporate deceit associated with <strong>Vishav Sharma</strong> and his network.</p>
