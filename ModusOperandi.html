    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Kantika Import Export and Trading Pvt Ltd, run by <strong>Vishav Sharma</strong>, has been linked to a multi-layered scam structure targeting Indian importers and traders. Victims have reported losses ranging from ‚Çπ30 lakh to ‚Çπ5 crore in advance payments for goods that were never delivered.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-3">üß© How the Scam Works</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Fake Supplier Setup:</strong> Kantika first finds a scam supplier (usually overseas) offering extremely low prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Forged Documents:</strong> Kantika collects documents like invoices or packing lists from the fake supplier to build trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting Buyers:</strong> Indian buyers are approached with under-market rates, backed by fake supply documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Advance Collection:</strong> Kantika takes a 30‚Äì50% advance from the buyer (often in crores).</li>
      <li><strong>Partial Payment to Scam Supplier:</strong> Kantika transfers a portion to the fake supplier and keeps the margin.</li>
      <li><strong>Goods Never Arrive:</strong> The scam supplier disappears. No goods are delivered to the Indian buyer.</li>
      <li><strong>Blame-Shifting:</strong> Kantika claims they are victims too and blame the supplier. They may cite MEA involvement to stall.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-10 mb-3">üîê How to Protect Yourself</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Verify both the <strong>buyer and supplier credentials</strong> independently through official trade portals.</li>
      <li><strong>Refuse advance-heavy deals</strong> without verifiable track record or port-side verification.</li>
      <li>Check company history, <strong>past names, directors, and addresses</strong> via MCA and GST databases.</li>
      <li>Avoid traders who act as <strong>middlemen without clear liability</strong> or insurance.</li>
      <li>Report suspicious activity to <strong>DGFT, Police, and MEA</strong> if overseas elements are involved.</li>
    </ul>
