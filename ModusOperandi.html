    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Kantika Import Export and Trading Pvt Ltd, led by <strong>Vishav Sharma</strong>, operates a sophisticated multi-layered scam that has targeted Indian importers and traders across various sectors. Victims have reported advance payment losses ranging from ‚Çπ30 lakh to ‚Çπ5 crore.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-3">üß© Step-by-Step Fraud Mechanism</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Fake Supplier Setup:</strong> They identify a scam supplier (often overseas) who quotes abnormally low rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Forged Supply Documentation:</strong> They obtain documents like packing lists, invoices, and COAs from the scam supplier to appear credible.</li>
      <li><strong>Buyer Targeting:</strong> Indian traders are approached with these documents and offered deals well below market price.</li>
      <li><strong>Advance Collection:</strong> Buyers are asked to pay a 30‚Äì50% booking amount upfront.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Cheques & LC Trap:</strong> To build buyer trust, Kantika offers security cheques or even arranges a <strong>transferable Letter of Credit</strong> via a trusted bank.</li>
      <li><strong>LC Encashment Scheme:</strong> Kantika then looks for a third party (shell firm or another trader) to encash the LC, demanding 30% in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit Extraction:</strong> They keep the margin and send a portion to the fake supplier.</li>
      <li><strong>No Delivery Ever Happens:</strong> The supplier disappears, and Kantika claims they too are victims.</li>
      <li><strong>Excuses & Delay:</strong> They blame the overseas supplier, cite MEA intervention, and continue the charade while preparing for the next scam cycle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-10 mb-3">üè¢ Use of WeWork Address as a Disguise</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Kantika operates from <strong>HD-071, We Work DLF Two Horizon Centre, Gurgaon</strong> ‚Äî a shared coworking space. This address is used strategically to appear professional and trustworthy, masking the lack of a real operational setup. Victims often feel reassured by the location's prestige, unaware that it‚Äôs simply a rented desk space.
